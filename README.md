## Bootstrap-Portfolio 

## Description

This landing page was created for visitors who are looking to hire a web developer. The scope is to provide the visitors with information about me and the skills I'm working to acquire as well as the projects I've worked on so far. In particular, the page includes links that will redirect the visitor to the applications I deployed and links to pages about the technologies I'm learning about. It also includes my contact details and links to my profiles on some of the platforms I use.

Working on this project, I learned more about using Bootstrap to build a web page that is also responsive.
